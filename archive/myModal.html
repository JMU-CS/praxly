       Feel free to switch between the blocks and the text whenever you please!</p>
    <p>ðŸ“• The <b>Book</b> Icon is the manual, which is the reference to the pseudocode that this was made for.</p>
    <p>ðŸ”—The Blue links are example programs.

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>âœ… This is in very early release, but as of now everything on the blocks list will work properly.</li>
      <li>ðŸš¨ error messages are probably going to be inconsistent.
          I'm sure there will be many scenarios I didn't think of that will cause errors.</li>
      <li>ðŸ˜” There is currently no support for object-oriented programming.</li>
